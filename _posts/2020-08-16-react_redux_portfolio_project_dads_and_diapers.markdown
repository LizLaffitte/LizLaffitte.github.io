### Inspiration
Dads & Diapers was inspired by my own experience as a new mom. Before having a child, I never once thought about changing tables, their availabilty or their condition. As my husband and I first started to venture out of the house with our new baby, we soon realized that changing tables are a rare commodity in mens restrooms. 

While the BABIES Act now requires changing tables in all publicly accessible, *federal* buildings, private businesses often fall short.

Dads & Diapers was built as a resource for parents of small children. It allows users to add listings of local businesses and review them based on the availability and condition of changing tables.

### Technologies

This app is build with a Rails API backend and a React/Redux frontend and is written in Ruby, JavaScript, HTML & CSS.

### Roadmap
I would like to incorporate a geocoding/maps API so that I can visually display the added listings on a map.  Once these features are complete, I will deploy the application on Heroku.
