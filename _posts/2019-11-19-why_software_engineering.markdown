For the first fifteen years of my life I shared a room with my (at the time) surly older sister. Absolutely every centimeter of that room was fiercely contested, and border violations were not tolerated. The only acceptable reason for crossing into enemy territory was to gain access to our most prized possession: the giant hunk of plastic in the corner running Windows 95. The monitor was so deep it barely fit on our desk and we only had the option to play Solitaire, Minesweeper or Skunny, but I was in love. 

As we got older, the family computer moved into our parents’ room, but my fascination never waned. AIM, MySpace, Homestar Runner, Rayman? I was obsessed. It didn’t hurt that my Dad had worked as a Systems Administrator since I was little. Technical prowess and quick, critical thinking were impressed upon me, and spare computer parts surrounded me.

But when I left home to attend Florida State University, the thought of majoring in Computer Science didn’t even occur to me. My other loves – reading, writing and making people happy – won out and I majored in English. 

Fast forward through the montage of all-nighters, inspiring professors and poetry slams (I was an English major, what did you expect?). I finally graduated and eventually landed a position as a content writer/editor for a small marketing firm. Imagine my surprise when, on my first day on the job, I was presented with a very technical task: fixing a (very) broken HTML email newsletter. That one, hideous, entirely too complicated for no reason, email stoked a fire in me. I realized that: 1. Solving problems with programming was endlessly fascinating and 2. I was pretty good at it.

So, I learned how to make HTML emails behave in clients from Gmail to the most dreaded version of Outlook. HTML led to CSS, both inline in emails and external for the websites I helped manage. Working with websites led to dabbling in PHP, JavaScript and jQuery. I learned how to solve problems, but more so I learned how to ask a great question. 

I started pursuing languages outside of what I encountered at work. I bought a book on [building computer games in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Invent-Your-Computer-Games-Python/dp/1593277954/ref=pd_sbs_14_img_0/131-4245440-5530766?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1593277954&pd_rd_r=ef7954fa-4d1e-454d-aa3b-10bc4738e0c9&pd_rd_w=pTL4x&pd_rd_wg=sBNZM&pf_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&pf_rd_r=6C110ZN6PTC9VZ5D1AJH&psc=1&refRID=6C110ZN6PTC9VZ5D1AJH). I built a simple Hangman game and showed it to my toddler. He (obviously) cannot read or spell, and he didn’t really understand what we were doing, but he absolutely loved playing a game with his mom that she created. To be fair, he’s a fan of most things I do, but his excitement solidified my own. 

Why software engineering? It allows me to solve fascinating, frustrating problems; create in ways that bring joy to other people; and be a lifelong learner. What more could you want?
